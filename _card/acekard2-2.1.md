The original Acekard2/2.1 uses AKAIO 1.9.0. If your cart fails the clone check, it can instead use the BL2CK kernel. AKAIO has very good game and homebrew compatibilty, so this is one of the more reliable carts out there.

Unlike the newer Acekard2i, the firmware on these carts cannot be flashed to support newer DSi/3DS firmware versions. It also cannot be flashed with ntrboot as a result.
