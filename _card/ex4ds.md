The EX4DS is a cart based on R4iLS hardware, marketed as a SuperCard DSTWO competitor. Like the DSTWO, it contains extra hardware for running cart-specific plugins that can be launched from its menu. Currently, these include accelerated movie and music playback, and a GBA emulator. This cart's kernel is also the source of AceOS - the Ace3DS team used the EX4DS' start-up launch menu for the AOS launch menu.

#### Setup Instructions (AOS)
AOS is a multi-loader for Ace3DS+ and related carts. You can find a link to an updated repack here: <https://github.com/flashcarts/AOS>

1. Download AOS for for EX4DS
1. Extract the AOS for EX4DS .zip file to your SD card root.
1. Place any game ROMs you'd like to play into a folder of your choice which isn't the `__rpg` folder.
    - (Optional) You may wish to use the `/roms/` folder structure which comes with AOS for easy organisation. For instance, `.gba` ROMs will go into the `/roms/gba/` folder, `.nds` ROMs will go into the `/roms/nds/` folder, etc.
