This flashcart has two modes. A DS mode and a "3DS" mode. DS mode will boot into the regular Ace3DS+ kernel.
The 3DS mode is slightly different; It doesn't play 3DS games as the name might imply. It is simply an ntrboot mode that can be used to hack your 3DS or to recover from bricks. You can read more about it at [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot).

When the switch is in the top position, it is in ntrboot mode. It is **normal** for the flashcart to not appear on the homescreen.
When the switch is in the bottom position, it is in DS mode. You should see `SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis` as the icon.

Keep in mind that this flashcart **will not work** in either mode without a microSD card inserted.
