This flashcart is a clone of the DSTTi. This is not to be confused with R4iTT's Acekard Clone which runs BL2CK OS, the main difference is the Acekard based R4iTT will not have a screw on the back while the DSTTi based one will have a screw on the back.

**Do not** attempt to use YSMenu or TTMenu on this flashcart if it does not have a screw on the back, those variants are Acekard-based will be **bricked** by those kernels.
