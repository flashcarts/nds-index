The R4i Platinum is an R4iTT card that seems to closely relate to the r4dspro.com cart including the same issues with sleep mode not working and multi-block DLDI being broken. It uses the r4dspro.com version of BL2CK.

Do not attempt to run YSMenu on this flashcart, doing so will cause it to **brick**!
