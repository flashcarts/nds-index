The R4i Platinum is an R4iTT card that seems to closely relate to the r4dspro.com cart including the same issues with sleep mode not working and multi-block DLDI being broken.

Do not attempt to run YSMenu on this flashcart, doing so will cause it to **brick**!

### Setup Instructions (r4iplat.com 2.6)
1. [Format the SD card you are using to FAT32](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card)
1. Download the r4iplat.com kernel
1. Extract the r4iplat.com kernel .zip file to your SD card root.
1. Place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play into a folder of your choice which isn't the `_SYSTEM_` or `MOONSHL` folder.
    - (Optional) You may want to create a `Games` folder to store your ROMs in to keep the root of your SD card organised.
