The Acekard 3 is a clone of the carts made by the Acekard team. It's label appears to be very similar to the Acekard 2, with the main differences being the website listed on the cart and the red 3 instead of a grey 2. It was confirmed on the AKAIO forums that the [Acekard 3 was not made by the Acekard team](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317004544/http://akaio.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=909&sid=4f27df9fddabe5160fc80bc05e5d3038).
