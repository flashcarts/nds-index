The Acekard R.P.G. is unique in that it has both NAND storage and a microSD card slot. Using a mini USB cable, you can transfer files to the carts NAND and use it without a microSD card. The NAND capacity is 1GB which is quite small, you may have to use a microSD card if you intend on storing many files on it.

The Acekard R.P.G. was one of the carts officially supported by the Wood kernel, we would recommend using WoodRPG 1.62 over AKAIO or AKMenu4.
