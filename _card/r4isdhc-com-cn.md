This flashcart is an R4iLS clone. This means that it will not work without a microSD card inserted into the card. This flashcart is also being sold with different coloured shells and labels, though the hardware inside is mostly the same across all of them.

Older variants of this flashcart can be flashed with ntrboot. However, once flashed, they cannot be reflashed to their DS firmware. Newer models cannot be flashed with ntrboot.
