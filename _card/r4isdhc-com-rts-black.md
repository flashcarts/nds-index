This flashcart is an M3 DS Real clone by `r4isdhc.com`. It is not compatible M3 Sakura, though it can use YSMenu with flashcard-bootstrap.

There is also a variant of this flashcart with `2025` written on the label, those carts are not M3 DS Real clones but are instead [r4isdhc.com 2014+ DEMON clones](/card/r4isdhc-com-2014).
