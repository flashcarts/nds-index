The original R4 is limited to microSD cards only (up to 2GB in capacity). The best kernel to use on it would be `Wood R4 1.62` as the stock kernel isn't great to use.

1:1 clones of the original R4 used be sold on AliExpress up until around 2024, and are can still be easily obtained on the used market, however it is not recommended to buy them due to the lack of SDHC support. The main advantage of this cart was that the `Wood R4 1.62` kernel had excellent compatibility with games.
