These flashcarts use the EvolutionOS kernel. This is a highly-compatible kernel that can run almost all games, romhacks, and homebrew, and also comes with extra features not commonly found in other carts, like Real-Time-Save and an in-game menu.

This is similar to the DSOne SDHC but supports the DSi. A USB dongle was included in the box in order to perform firmware updates on the cart.

More detailed information about setup and usage can be found in the [DSOne Manual GitHub](https://github.com/Sanrax/DSOneManual/tree/main)
