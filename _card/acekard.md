The original Acekard was the first flashcart released by the Acekard team. It has a few drawbacks compared to other flashcarts however.
It's main issue is that it is locked down to Acekard's proprietary file system, known as AKFS. This can cause major issues when trying to run homebrew applications. This also locks you down to Acekard's AKManager software, which does not appear to work on modern versions of Windows. It also doesn't support SDHC microSD cards.

We do not have setup instructions for this flashcart, if you have an original Acekard, please open an issue on our GitHub page!
