This is a flashcart by r4i-gold.com which appears to be a clone of the pk3ds.com cart. It has both a micro SD card slot and a proprietary USB port. The USB port appears to be used to provide power to the flashcart so that it can upgrade it’s firmware from the micro SD card. We currently do not have any archive of the firmware upgrades for this flashcart.

The interesting quirk about this flashcart is that it is a hybrid of a DSTTi and R4 and partially supports the R4's DLDI. This flashcart was allegedly never released and years later after the website was taken offline, Aliexpress listings of these carts started to appear.

This flashcart was also being sold as a “DSTTi Gold from ndstt.com” on AliExpress. This flashcart wasn’t made by the DSTT team, it’s just a relabelled version of this flashcart.
