The SuperCard DSTWO is a flashcart that contains extra hardware (A MIPS-based Ingenic JZ4732 CPU and 32MB of RAM) that allows for emulation and video playback usually not possible on the Nintendo DS. Emulators for GBA and SNES as well as a video player are available as plugins for EvolutionOS's plugin system which make use of the additional CPU and RAM.

The DSTWO Plus is based on the DSTWO and runs on the same version of EvolutionOS but has support for the 3DS.
