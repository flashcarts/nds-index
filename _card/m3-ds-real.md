The M3 DS Real is the second Slot-1 flashcart from the M3 Adapter team. As the M3 team stopped updating Sakura around 2011, the Sakura kernel is unable to play quite a few games that were released later on in the DS lifespan. It is recomended to use YSMenu as either the primary kernel, or as a dual-boot kernel so you can fallback to YS for games that fail to load on Sakura.

While this cart does supports SDHC SD cards, Sakura/TouchPod has issues with cards that are 64GB or larger. The nds loader will simply refuse to load games, or load the game but crash/freeze soon after. Note that YSMenu handles 64GB and larger cards just fine on the M3 DS Real, when configured as primary kernel.
