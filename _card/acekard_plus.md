The Acekard+ was made to be an improved version of the [original Acekard](/cards/acekard). Instead of being locked down to using Acekard's proprietary file system (AKFS) like the original Acekard, the Acekard+ supported FAT file systems as well. 

The Acekard+ uses a forked version of AKMenu4 backported from the Acekard R.P.G, see the instructions below on how to set it up.

### Setup Instructions (AKMenu4)
1. [Format the SD card you are using to FAT32](https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html)
1. Download AKMenu4
1. Extract the AKMenu4 .zip file to your SD card root.
1. Place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play into a folder of your choice which isn't the `system` folder.
    - (Optional) You may want to create a `Games` folder to store your ROMs in to keep the root of your SD card organised.
