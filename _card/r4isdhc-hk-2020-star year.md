This flashcart is an R4iLS clone. It is typically sold as a "Dual Core" flashcart with a year of 2020 or newer from r4isdhc.hk with the year being inside a star shape inside of a banner. This means that it will not work without a microSD card inserted into the card.

This flashcart cannot be flashed for ntrboot. Note that some [2020 models have been shipped with R4iTT-clone hardware](/card/r4isdhc-hk-pre2020) instead of being based on the R4iLS.
