This flashcart is a clone of the Acekard. This is not to be confused with R4iTT's DSTTi Clone which runs YSMenu, the main difference is the Acekard based R4iTT will not have a screw on the back while the DSTTi based one will have a screw on the back.

**Do not** attempt to use YSMenu or TTMenu on this flashcart as they will **brick** your flashcart!
